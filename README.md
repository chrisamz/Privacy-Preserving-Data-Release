# Privacy-Preserving Data Release

## Description

The Privacy-Preserving Data Release project aims to develop differentially private data release mechanisms for mixed-type data using latent factor models. This project focuses on ensuring data privacy while maintaining the utility of the released data. It leverages techniques from differential privacy and latent factor models to anonymize data effectively.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Differential Privacy:** Ensuring the privacy of individual data points within a dataset.
- **Latent Factor Models:** Using latent variables to represent the underlying structure of the data.
- **Data Anonymization:** Removing personally identifiable information to protect individual privacy.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare Data Sharing:** Sharing patient data with researchers while preserving privacy.
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics:** Conducting data analysis without compromising individual privacy.
- **Secure Data Publishing:** Publishing data in a way that prevents re-identification of individuals.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Healthcare records, survey data, transaction logs.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Latent Factor Models

Develop latent factor models to represent the underlying structure of the mixed-type data.

- **Techniques Used:** Matrix factorization, Bayesian latent factor models.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

### 3. Differential Privacy Mechanisms

Implement differentially private mechanisms to ensure the privacy of the data release.

- **Techniques Used:** Laplace mechanism, exponential mechanism, randomized response.
- **Libraries/Tools:** Diffprivlib, PySyft, TensorFlow Privacy.

### 4. Data Release and Evaluation

Release the differentially private data and evaluate its utility and privacy guarantees.

- **Techniques Used:** Utility metrics, privacy budget analysis, re-identification risk assessment.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/privacy_preserving_data_release.git
   cd privacy_preserving_data_release
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. Place raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess data, develop latent factor models, implement differential privacy mechanisms, and evaluate the results:
   - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `latent_factor_models.ipynb`
   - `differential_privacy_mechanisms.ipynb`
   - `data_release_evaluation.ipynb`

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train the latent factor models:
   ```bash
   python src/latent_factor_models.py --train
   ```

2. Implement differential privacy mechanisms:
   ```bash
   python src/differential_privacy_mechanisms.py --apply
   ```

3. Evaluate the data release:
   ```bash
   python src/data_release_evaluation.py --evaluate
   ```

### Results and Evaluation

- **Latent Factor Models:** Successfully developed and trained latent factor models to represent mixed-type data.
- **Differential Privacy:** Implemented differentially private mechanisms ensuring data privacy.
- **Data Utility:** Achieved a balance between data privacy and utility, maintaining the usefulness of the released data while protecting individual privacy.
